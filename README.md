# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Convolutional Neural Network

# Result
	Upto 94.63% accuracy in correct classifying breast cancer mammographic images into 7 Classes
i.e. calcification, well-defined/circumscribed masses, spiculated masses, ill-defined masses, architectural distortion, asymmetry, normal image.

# Purpose:
Early detection of breast cancer is very crucial to save the valuable lives. However, it is not an easy one due to several uncertainties in detection using different technique like mammogram, MRI, CT etc. However, a Deep Learning Model can perform well as it  is inspired by the functionality and the structure of the biological nervous system.


# Methods 
Images are taken from MIAS database[1]. MIAS database is having 322 mammographic image of breasts, with each breast image being labelled in one of 7 Classes i.e.calcification, well-defined/circumscribed masses, spiculated masses, ill-defined masses, architectural distortion, asymmetry, normal image.
In this project the mammographic images are passed through a convolution neural network for feature extraction and then through many hidden layers of neural network. In the training phase images are fed to the deep learning model[2] and the model try to extract the key features based upon the actual classes of the images. After training, in testing phase when we give a new image to the system it will extract the features and classify the given image in one of the classes.



# Scope
India having population 1.2 billion, everyone cannot afford the cancer detections test. In remote areas where there are no hospitals and doctors the situation is even worse. With our findings, anyone and everyone can check whether she is having breast cancer, that up to a very high accuracy. The female just need to go to nearest healthcare center and take a mammographic picture of breast and rest deep learning model will solve the problem.While dealing with large amount of data, deep learning model outperforms any other model of classification. Data scientist have reached 99.7% accuracy in image classification using deep learning models.
